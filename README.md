# Study of the Effects of the Fuego Volcano Eruption (June 3, 2018)

This repository contains the code and data analysis for studying the effects of the Fuego Volcano eruption on June 3, 2018, using remote sensing techniques. The study focuses on quantifying vegetation loss using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) from Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 satellite images.

## Introduction
The eruption of the Fuego Volcano in Guatemala on June 3, 2018, was one of the most significant volcanic events in recent years. The study aims to assess the impact of the eruption by analyzing vegetation loss using NDVI and NBR indices.

## Study Area
The Fuego Volcano is located in Guatemala, near several populated areas. The eruption caused significant destruction, particularly due to Pyroclastic Density Currents (PDCs). The study focuses on analyzing the affected ravines, such as Las Lajas, El Jute, and Ceniza.

## Data
- **Satellite Imagery:** Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data were used for the analysis.
- **Timeframes:** The study compares data from before and after the 2018 eruption and also includes a 2023-2024 analysis for long-term effects.

## Methodology
1. **Data Selection:** Selection of relevant Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 images.
2. **Preprocessing:** Preprocessing steps include cloud masking and radiometric corrections.
3. **Indices Calculation:** Calculation of NDVI and NBR indices for vegetation and burn severity analysis.
4. **Classification:** dNBR values are classified to assess burn severity.

## Results
- **Burn Severity:** Analysis of burn severity using Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data.
- **Vegetation Recovery:** NDVI analysis shows the vegetation recovery trends over time.
- **Long-term Effects:** Comparison between 2018 and 2023-2024 shows the long-term impacts on vegetation.

## Discussion
The study highlights the utility of remote sensing in disaster management and the effectiveness of NDVI and NBR in monitoring vegetation changes after volcanic eruptions.
